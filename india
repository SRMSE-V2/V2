==Etymology==
{{Main|Names of India}}

The name ''India'' is derived from ''Indus'', which originates from the [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]] word ''[[Hindus|Hinduš]]''. The latter term stems from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''Sindhu'', which was the historical local appellation for the [[Indus River]].{{sfn|Oxford English Dictionary}} The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] referred to the Indians as ''Indoi'' (Ινδοί), which translates as "the people of the Indus".{{sfn|Kuiper|2010|p = 86}}

The geographical term ''Bharat'' ({{IPA-hns|ˈbʱaːrət̪|pron|hi-Bharat.ogg}}), which is recognised by the [[Constitution of India]] as an official name for the country,{{sfn|Ministry of Law and Justice 2008}} is used by [[Names of the Republic of India in its official languages|many Indian languages]] in its variations. The [[eponym]] of ''Bharat'' is [[Bharata (emperor)|Bharata]], a theological figure that Hindu scriptures describe as a legendary emperor of ancient India.

''[[Hindustan]]'' ({{IPA-hns|ɦɪnd̪ʊˈst̪aːn||Hindustan.ogg}}) was originally a [[Persian language|Persian]] word that meant "Land of the Hindus"; prior to 1947, it referred to a region that encompassed northern India and [[Pakistan]]. It is occasionally used to solely denote India in its entirety.{{sfn|Kaye|1997|pp = 639–640}}{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica}}

==History==
{{Main|History of India|History of the Republic of India}}

===Ancient India===
The earliest authenticated [[Anatomically modern humans|human]] remains in [[South Asia]] date to about 30,000 years ago.{{sfn|Petraglia|Allchin||2007|p=6}} Nearly contemporaneous [[Mesolithic]] rock art sites have been found in many parts of the Indian subcontinent, including at the [[Bhimbetka rock shelters]] in [[Madhya Pradesh]].{{sfn|Singh|2009|pp = 89–93}} Around 7000 BCE, the first known [[Neolithic]] settlements appeared on the subcontinent in [[Mehrgarh]] and other sites in western Pakistan.{{sfn|Possehl|2003|pp = 24–25}} These gradually developed into the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley Civilisation]],{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|pp = 21–23}} the first urban culture in South Asia;{{sfn|Singh|2009|p = 181}} It flourished during 2600–1900&nbsp;BCE in Pakistan and western India.{{sfn|Possehl|2003|p = 2}} Centred on cities such as [[Mohenjo-daro]], [[Harappa]], [[Dholavira]], and [[Kalibangan]], and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.{{sfn|Singh|2009|p = 181}}

During the period 2000–500 BCE, in terms of culture, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the [[Chalcolithic]] to the [[Iron Age]].{{sfn|Singh|2009|p = 255}} The [[Vedas]], the oldest scriptures of Hinduism,{{sfn|Singh|2009|pp = 186–187}} were composed during this period,{{sfn|Witzel|2003|pp = 68–69}} and historians have analysed these to posit a [[Vedic period|Vedic culture]] in the [[Punjab region]] and the upper [[Indo-Gangetic Plain|Gangetic Plain]].{{sfn|Singh|2009|p = 255}} Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of [[Indo-Aryan migration]] into the subcontinent.{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|p = 31}}{{sfn|Singh|2009|pp = 186–187}}{{sfn|Stein|2010|p = 47}} The [[caste system]] arose during this period, which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, free peasants and traders, and lastly the indigenous peoples who were regarded as impure; and small tribal units gradually coalesced into monarchical, state-level polities.{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|pp = 41–43}}{{sfn|Singh|2009|p = 200}} On the [[Deccan Plateau]], archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation.{{sfn|Singh|2009|p = 255}} In southern India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of [[megalith]]ic monuments dating from this period,{{sfn|Singh|2009|pp = 250–251}} as well as by nearby traces of agriculture, irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.{{sfn|Singh|2009|pp = 250–251}}
[[File:Indischer Maler des 6. Jahrhunderts 001.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Damaged brown painting of a reclining man and woman.|Paintings at the [[Ajanta Caves]] in [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra]], 6th century]]

In the late [[Vedic period]], around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the [[Ganges]] Plain and the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the ''[[mahajanapada]]s''.{{sfn|Singh|2009|pp = 260-265}}{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|pp = 53–54}} The emerging urbanisation and the orthodoxies of this age also created heterodox religious movements, two of which became independent religions. Buddhism, based on the teachings of [[Gautama Buddha]] attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India.{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|pp = 54–56}}{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 21}}{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 67–68}} Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar, [[Mahavira]].{{sfn|Singh|2009|pp = 312–313}} In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up [[Nekkhamma|renunciation]] as an ideal,{{sfn|Singh|2009|p = 300}} and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of [[Magadha]] had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan Empire]].{{sfn|Singh|2009|p = 319}} The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent excepting the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas.{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 78–79}}{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|p = 70}} The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for [[Ashoka]]'s renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist ''[[Dharma (Buddhism)|dhamma]]''.{{sfn|Singh|2009|p = 367}}{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|p = 63}}

The [[Sangam literature]] of the [[Tamil language]] reveals that, between 200 BCE and 200 CE, the southern peninsula was being ruled by the [[Chera Dynasty|Cheras]], the [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]], and the [[Pandyan Dynasty|Pandyas]], dynasties that traded extensively with the [[Roman Empire]] and with [[Western Asia|West]] and [[Southeast Asia|South-East Asia]].{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 89–90}}{{sfn|Singh|2009|pp = 408–415}} In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family, leading to increased subordination of women.{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 92–95}}{{sfn|Singh|2009|p = 319}} By the 4th and 5th centuries, the [[Gupta Empire]] had created in the greater Ganges Plain a complex system of administration and taxation that became a model for later Indian kingdoms.{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|pp = 89–91}}{{sfn|Singh|2009|p = 545}} Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion rather than the management of ritual began to assert itself.{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 98–99}} The renewal was reflected in a flowering of [[Sculpture in the Indian subcontinent|sculpture]] and [[Architecture of India|architecture]], which found patrons among an urban elite.{{sfn|Singh|2009|p = 545}} [[Sanskrit literature#Classical Sanskrit literature|Classical Sanskrit literature]] flowered as well, and [[History of science and technology in the Indian subcontinent|Indian science]], [[Indian astronomy|astronomy]], [[Ayurveda|medicine]], and [[Indian mathematics|mathematics]] made significant advances.{{sfn|Singh|2009|p = 545}}

===Medieval India===
[[File:Big Temple-Temple.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The granite [[gopuram|tower]] of [[Brihadeeswarar Temple]] in [[Thanjavur]] was completed in 1010 CE by [[Raja Raja Chola I]].]]

The Indian early medieval age, 600 CE to 1200 CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 132}} When [[Harsha]] of [[Kannauj]], who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukya]] ruler of the Deccan.{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 119–120}} When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the [[Pala Empire|Pala]] king of [[Bengal]].{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 119–120}} When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the [[Pallava]]s from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south.{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 119–120}} No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond his core region.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 132}} During this time, pastoral peoples whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 121–122}} The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 121–122}}

In the 6th and 7th centuries, the first [[Bhakti|devotional hymns]] were created in the Tamil language.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 123}} They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all [[Languages of India|modern languages of the subcontinent]].{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 123}} Indian royalty, [[Maharaja|big]] and [[Samanta|small]], and the temples they patronised, drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 124}} Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 124}} By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt in South-East Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day [[Myanmar]], [[Thailand]], [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]], [[Vietnam]], [[Philippines]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Java]].{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 127–128}} Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; South-East Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 127–128}}

After the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using [[courser (horse)|swift-horse]] cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia's north-western plains, leading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic [[Delhi Sultanate]] in 1206.{{sfn|Ludden|2002|p = 68}} The sultanate was to control much of North India, and to make many forays into South India. Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 47}}{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 6}} By repeatedly repulsing [[Mongol Empire|Mongol raiders]] in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of [[Human migration|migration]] of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north.{{sfn|Ludden|2002|p = 67}}{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|pp = 50–51}} The sultanate's raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous [[Vijayanagara Empire]].{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 53}} Embracing a strong [[Shaivism|Shaivite]] tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control much of peninsular India,{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 12}} and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 53}}

In the early 16th century, northern India, being then under mainly Muslim rulers,{{sfn|Robb|2001|p = 80}} fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 164}} The resulting [[Mughal Empire]] did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule, but rather balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 115}}{{sfn|Robb|2001|pp = 90–91}} and diverse and inclusive ruling elites,{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 17}} leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 152}} Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under [[Akbar]], the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 17}} The Mughal state's economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 158}} and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency,{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 169}} caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 152}} The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion,{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 152}} resulting in greater patronage of [[Mughal painting|painting]], literary forms, textiles, and [[Mughal architecture|architecture]].{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 186}} Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]], the [[Rajputs]], and the [[Sikh empire|Sikhs]], gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp = 23–24}} Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp = 23–24}} As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 256}} The "single most important power" that emerged in the early modern period was the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha confederacy]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/285248/India/46984/Political-and-economic-decentralization-during-the-Mughal-decline#toc46986 |title=Regional states, c. 1700–1850 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.}}</ref>

By the early 18th century, with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred, a number of European trading companies, including the English [[East India Company]], had established coastal outposts.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 286}}{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp = 44–49}} The East India Company's control of the seas, greater resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly flex its military muscle and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite; both these factors were crucial in allowing the Company to gain control over the [[Bengal]] region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies.{{sfn|Robb|2001|pp = 98–100}}{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 286}}{{sfn|Ludden|2002|pp = 128–132}}{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp = 51–55}} Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annex or subdue most of India by the 1820s.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp = 68–71}} India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had, but was instead supplying the British empire with raw materials, and many historians consider this to be the onset of India's colonial period.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 286}} By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and itself effectively made an arm of British administration, the Company began to more consciously enter non-economic arenas such as education, social reform, and culture.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 289}}

Historians consider India's modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848 of [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]] as Governor General of the [[Company rule in India|East India Company]] set the stage for changes essential to a modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and the [[English Education Act 1835|education]] of citizens. Technological changes—among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe.{{sfn|Robb|2001|pp = 151–152}}{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp = 94–99}}{{sfn|Brown|1994|p = 83}}{{sfn|Peers|2006|p = 50}} However, disaffection with the Company also grew during this time, and set off the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]]. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp = 100–103}}{{sfn|Brown|1994|pp = 85–86}} Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and to the [[British Raj|direct administration of India]] by the British government. Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 239}}{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp = 103–108}} In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to the founding of the [[Indian National Congress]] in 1885.{{sfn|Robb|2001|p = 183}}{{sfn|Sarkar|1983|pp = 1–4}}{{sfn|Copland|2001|pp = ix–x}}{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 123}}

The rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks—many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 260}} There was an increase in the number of large-scale [[Famine in India|famines]],{{sfn|Bose|Jalal|2011|p = 117}} and, despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers, little industrial employment was generated for Indians.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 258}} There were also salutary effects: commercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled Punjab, led to increased food production for internal consumption.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 126}} The railway network provided critical famine relief,{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 97}} notably reduced the cost of moving goods,{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 97}} and helped nascent Indian-owned industry.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 126}} After World War I, in which [[Indian Army during World War I|some one million Indians served]],{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 163}} a new period began. It was marked by British reforms but also repressive legislation, by more strident Indian calls for self-rule, and by the beginnings of a [[nonviolent]] movement of non-cooperation, of which [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] would become the leader and enduring symbol.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 167}} During the 1930s, slow legislative reform was enacted by the British; the Indian National Congress won victories in the resulting elections.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp = 195–197}} The next decade was beset with crises: [[India in World War II|Indian participation in World War II]], the Congress's final push for non-cooperation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism. All were capped by the advent of independence in 1947, but tempered by the [[partition of India]] into two states: India and Pakistan.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 203}}

Vital to India's self-image as an independent nation was its constitution, completed in 1950, which put in place a secular and democratic republic.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 231}} In the 60 years since, India has had a mixed record of successes and failures.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp = 265–266}} It has remained a democracy with civil liberties, an active Supreme Court, and a largely independent press.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp = 265–266}} Economic liberalisation, which was begun in the 1990s, has created a large urban middle class, transformed India into [[List of countries by GDP (real) growth rate|one of the world's fastest-growing economies]],{{sfn|United States Department of Agriculture}} and increased its geopolitical clout.

India comprises the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the [[Indian Plate|Indian tectonic plate]], and part of the [[Indo-Australian Plate]].{{sfn|Ali|Aitchison|2005}} India's defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian plate, then part of the southern supercontinent [[Gondwana]], began a north-eastward [[Plate tectonics|drift]] caused by [[seafloor spreading]] to its south-west, and later, south and south-east.{{sfn|Ali|Aitchison|2005}}  Simultaneously, the vast [[Tethys Ocean|Tethyn]] [[oceanic crust]], to its northeast, began to [[subduction|subduct]] under the [[Eurasian plate]].{{sfn|Ali|Aitchison|2005}}  These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth's [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]], both created the [[Indian Ocean]] and caused the Indian [[continental crust]] eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the [[Himalayas]].{{sfn|Ali|Aitchison|2005}} Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast [[trough (geology)|trough]] that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment{{sfn|Dikshit & Schwartzberg|p = 7}} and now constitutes the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]].{{sfn|Prakash et al.|2000}} Cut off from the plain by the ancient [[Aravalli Range]] lies the [[Thar Desert]].{{sfn|Dikshit & Schwartzberg|p = 11}}

The original Indian plate survives as [[South India|peninsular India]], the oldest and geologically most stable part of India.  It extends as far north as the [[Satpura Range|Satpura]] and [[Vindhya Range|Vindhya]] ranges in central India. These parallel chains run from the Arabian Sea coast in Gujarat in the west to the coal-rich [[Chota Nagpur Plateau]] in Jharkhand in the east.{{sfn|Dikshit & Schwartzberg|p = 8}} To the south, the remaining peninsular landmass, the [[Deccan Plateau]], is flanked on the west and east by coastal ranges known as the [[Western Ghats|Western]] and [[Eastern Ghats]];{{sfn|Dikshit & Schwartzberg|pp = 9–10}} the plateau contains the country's oldest rock formations, some over one billion years old.

India's coastline measures {{Convert|7517|km|mi|-2}} in length; of this distance, {{Convert|5423|km|mi|-2}} belong to peninsular India and {{Convert|2094|km|mi|-2}} to the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep island chains.{{sfn|Kumar|Pathak|Pednekar|Raju|2006}} According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46% [[mudflat]]s or marshy shores.{{sfn|Kumar|Pathak|Pednekar|Raju|2006}}

Major Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the [[Ganges]] and the [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]], both of which drain into the [[Bay of Bengal]].{{sfn|Dikshit & Schwartzberg|p = 15}} Important tributaries of the Ganges include the [[Yamuna]] and the [[Kosi River|Kosi]]; the latter's extremely low gradient often leads to severe floods and course changes.{{sfn|Duff|1993|p = 353}} Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the [[Godavari River|Godavari]], the [[Mahanadi River|Mahanadi]], the [[Kaveri River|Kaveri]], and the [[Krishna River|Krishna]], which also drain into the Bay of Bengal;{{sfn|Dikshit & Schwartzberg|p = 16}} and the [[Narmada River|Narmada]] and the [[Tapti River|Tapti]], which drain into the [[Arabian Sea]].{{sfn|Dikshit & Schwartzberg|p = 17}} Coastal features include the marshy [[Rann of Kutch]] of western India and the alluvial [[Sundarbans]] delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh.{{sfn|Dikshit & Schwartzberg|p = 12}} India has two archipelagos: the [[Lakshadweep]], coral atolls off India's south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the [[Andaman Sea]].{{sfn|Dikshit & Schwartzberg|p = 13}}

The [[Climate of India|Indian climate]] is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter [[monsoon]]s.{{sfn|Chang|1967|pp = 391–394}} The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian [[katabatic wind]]s from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes.{{sfn|Posey|1994|p = 118}}{{sfn|Wolpert|2003|p = 4}} The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall.{{sfn|Chang|1967|pp = 391–394}} Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: [[Climate of India#Tropical wet|tropical wet]], [[Climate of India#Tropical dry|tropical dry]], [[Climate of India#Subtropical humid|subtropical humid]], and [[Climate of India#Montane|montane]].{{sfn|Heitzman|Worden|1996|p = 97}}

For most of the period between 1950—when India first became a republic—and the late 1980s, the Congress held a majority in the parliament. Since then, however, it has increasingly shared the political stage with the BJP,{{sfn|Sarkar|2007|p = 84}} as well as with powerful regional parties which have often forced the creation of multi-party [[coalition government|coalitions]] at the centre.{{sfn|Chander|2004|p = 117}}

In the Republic of India's first three general elections, in 1951, 1957, and 1962, the [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]-led Congress won easy victories. On Nehru's death in 1964, [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]] briefly became prime minister; he was succeeded, after his own unexpected death in 1966, by [[Indira Gandhi]], who went on to lead the Congress to election victories in 1967 and 1971. Following public discontent with the [[The Emergency (India)|state of emergency]] she declared in 1975, the Congress was voted out of power in 1977; the then-new [[Janata Party]], which had opposed the emergency, was voted in. Its government lasted just over three years. Voted back into power in 1980, the Congress saw a change in leadership in 1984, when Indira Gandhi was assassinated; she was succeeded by her son [[Rajiv Gandhi]], who won an easy victory in the general elections later that year. The Congress was voted out again in 1989 when a [[National Front (India)|National Front]] coalition, led by the newly formed [[Janata Dal]] in alliance with the [[Left Front (India)|Left Front]], won the elections; that government too proved relatively short-lived: it lasted just under two years.{{sfn|Bhambhri|1992|pp = 118, 143}} Elections were held again in 1991; no party won an absolute majority. But the Congress, as the largest single party, was able to form a [[minority government]] led by [[P. V. Narasimha Rao]].{{sfn|The Hindu 2008}}

A two-year period of political turmoil followed the general election of 1996. Several short-lived alliances shared power at the centre. The BJP formed a government briefly in 1996; it was followed by two comparatively long-lasting [[United Front (India)|United Front]] coalitions, which depended on external support. In 1998, the BJP was able to form a successful coalition, the [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA).

===Government===
{{Main|Government of India}}
{{See also|Elections in India}}

India is a [[federation]] with a [[parliamentary system]] governed under the [[Constitution of India]], which serves as the country's supreme legal document. It is a constitutional republic and [[representative democracy]], in which "[[majority rule]] is tempered by [[minority rights]] protected by [[Law of India|law]]". [[Federalism#India|Federalism in India]] defines the power distribution between the federal government and the [[States and territories of India|states]]. The government abides by constitutional [[separation of powers|checks and balances]]. The Constitution of India, which came into effect on 26 January 1950,{{sfn|Pylee|2003|a|p = 4}} states in its [[preamble to the Constitution of India|preamble]] that India is a [[sovereignty|sovereign]], [[Socialism in India|socialist]], [[secularism|secular]], [[liberal democracy|democratic]] [[republic]].{{sfn|Dutt|1998|p = 421}} India's form of government, traditionally described as "quasi-federal" with a strong centre and weak states,{{sfn|Wheare|1980|p = 28}} has grown increasingly federal since the late 1990s as a result of political, economic, and social changes.{{sfn|Echeverri-Gent|2002|pp = 19–20}}{{sfn|Sinha|2004|p = 25}}

The federal government comprises '''three''' branches:
* [[Executive (government)|Executive]]: The [[President of India]] is the head of state{{sfn|Sharma|2007|p = 31}} and is elected indirectly by a national [[electoral college]]{{sfn|Sharma|2007|p = 138}} for a five-year term.{{sfn|Gledhill|1970|p = 112}} The [[Prime Minister of India]] is the [[head of government]] and exercises most [[executive (government)|executive power]].{{sfn|Sharma|1950}} Appointed by the president,{{sfn|Sharma|2007|p = 162}} the prime minister is by convention supported by the [[political party|party]] or political alliance holding the majority of seats in the lower house of parliament.{{sfn|Sharma|1950}} The executive branch of the Indian government consists of the president, the vice-president, and the [[Council of Ministers of Republic of India|Council of Ministers]]—the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] being its executive committee—headed by the prime minister. Any minister holding a portfolio must be a member of one of the houses of parliament.{{sfn|Sharma|2007|p = 31}} In the Indian parliamentary system, the executive is subordinate to the legislature; the prime minister and his council are directly responsible to the lower house of the parliament.{{sfn|Mathew|2003|p = 524}}
* [[Legislature|Legislative]]: The legislature of India is the [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[Parliament of India|parliament]]. It operates under a [[Westminster system|Westminster-style]] parliamentary system and comprises the upper house called the [[Rajya Sabha]] ("Council of States") and the lower called the [[Lok Sabha]] ("House of the People").{{sfn|Gledhill|1970|p = 127}} The Rajya Sabha is a permanent body that has 245 members who serve in staggered six-year terms.{{sfn|Sharma|2007|p = 161}} Most are elected indirectly by the [[States and territories of India|state and territorial]] legislatures in numbers proportional to their state's share of the national population.{{sfn|Sharma|2007|p = 162}} All but two of the Lok Sabha's 545 members are directly elected by popular vote; they represent individual [[constituency|constituencies]] via five-year terms.{{sfn|Sharma|2007|p = 143}} The remaining two members are nominated by the president from among the [[Anglo-Indian]] community, in case the president decides that they are not adequately represented.{{sfn|Sharma|2007|p = 360}}
* [[Judiciary|Judicial]]: India has a unitary three-tier [[independent judiciary]]{{sfn|Neuborne|2003|p = 478}} that comprises the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]], headed by the [[Chief Justice of India]], 24 [[High Courts of India|High Courts]], and a large number of trial courts.{{sfn|Neuborne|2003|p = 478}} The Supreme Court has [[original jurisdiction]] over cases involving [[Fundamental Rights in India|fundamental rights]] and over disputes between states and the centre; it has [[appellate jurisdiction]] over the High Courts.{{sfn|Sharma|2007|pp = 238, 255}} It has the power both to declare the law and to strike down union or state laws which contravene the constitution.{{sfn|Sripati|1998|pp = 423–424}} The Supreme Court is also the ultimate interpreter of the constitution.{{sfn|Pylee|2003|b|p = 314}}

===Subdivisions===

India is a federation composed of 29 states and 7 [[Union Territory|union territories]].{{sfn|Library of Congress|2004}} All states, as well as the union territories of [[Puducherry]] and the [[National Capital Territory of Delhi]], have elected legislatures and governments, both patterned on the [[Westminster system|Westminster]] model. The remaining five union territories are directly ruled by the centre through appointed administrators. In 1956, under the [[States Reorganisation Act]], states were reorganised on a linguistic basis.{{sfn|Sharma|2007|p = 49}} Since then, their structure has remained largely unchanged. Each state or union territory is further divided into administrative [[Districts of India|districts]]. The districts in turn are further divided into [[tehsil]]s and ultimately into villages.

Since its independence in 1947, India has maintained cordial relations with most nations. In the 1950s, it strongly supported decolonisation in Africa and Asia and [[India and the Non-Aligned Movement|played a lead role]] in the [[Non-Aligned Movement]].{{sfn|Rothermund|2000|pp = 48, 227}} In the late 1980s, the Indian military twice intervened abroad at the invitation of neighbouring countries: a [[Indian Peace Keeping Force|peace-keeping operation]] in Sri Lanka between 1987 and 1990; and an armed intervention to prevent a [[1988 Maldives coup d'état|coup d'état attempt]] in Maldives. India has [[Indo-Pakistani relations|tense relations]] with neighbouring Pakistan; the two nations [[Indo-Pakistani wars and conflicts|have gone to war four times]]: in [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|1947]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971]], and [[Kargil War|1999]]. Three of these wars were fought over the [[Kashmir conflict|disputed territory of Kashmir]], while the fourth, the 1971 war, followed from India's support for the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|independence of Bangladesh]].{{sfn|Gilbert|2002|pp = 486–487}} After waging the 1962 [[Sino-Indian War]] and the 1965 war with Pakistan, India pursued close military and economic [[India-Soviet Union relations|ties with the Soviet Union]]; by the late 1960s, the Soviet Union was its largest arms supplier.{{sfn|Sharma|1999|p = 56}}

Aside from ongoing strategic [[India–Russia relations|relations with Russia]], India has wide-ranging [[India–Israel relations|defence relations with Israel]] and [[France–India relations|France]]. In recent years, it has played key roles in the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] and the [[World Trade Organisation]]. The nation has provided 100,000 [[Indian Armed Forces|military]] and [[Law enforcement in India|police]] personnel to serve in 35 UN peacekeeping operations across four continents.

China's [[596 (nuclear test)|nuclear test of 1964]], as well as its repeated threats to intervene in support of Pakistan in the 1965 war, convinced India to develop nuclear weapons.{{sfn|Perkovich|2001|pp = 60–86, 106–125}} India conducted its [[Smiling Buddha|first nuclear weapons test]] in 1974 and carried out [[Pokhran-II|further underground testing]] in 1998. Despite criticism and military sanctions, India has signed neither the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty]] nor the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]], considering both to be flawed and discriminatory.{{sfn|Kumar|2010}} India maintains a "[[no first use]]" nuclear policy and is developing a [[nuclear triad]] capability as a part of its "[[Minimum Credible Deterrence|minimum credible deterrence]]" doctrine.{{sfn|Nair|2007}}{{sfn|Pandit|2009}} It is developing a [[Indian Ballistic Missile Defense Program|ballistic missile defence shield]] and, in collaboration with Russia, a [[Sukhoi/HAL FGFA|fifth-generation fighter jet]].{{sfn|The Hindu 2011}} Other indigenous military projects involve the design and implementation of [[Vikrant class aircraft carrier|''Vikrant''-class aircraft carriers]] and [[Arihant class submarine|''Arihant''-class nuclear submarines]].{{sfn|The Hindu 2011}}

Since the end of the [[Cold War]], India has increased its economic, strategic, and military cooperation with the [[India–United States relations|United States]] and the [[India–European Union relations|European Union]].{{sfn|Europa 2008}} In 2008, a [[U.S.–India Civil Nuclear Agreement|civilian nuclear agreement]] was signed between India and the United States. Although India possessed nuclear weapons at the time and was not party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it received waivers from the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] and the [[Nuclear Suppliers Group]], ending earlier restrictions on India's nuclear technology and commerce. As a consequence, India became the sixth ''de facto'' nuclear weapons state.{{sfn|The Times of India 2008}} India subsequently signed cooperation agreements involving [[Nuclear power in India|civilian nuclear energy]] with Russia,{{sfn|British Broadcasting Corporation 2009}} France,{{sfn|Rediff 2008 a}} the [[India–United Kingdom relations|United Kingdom]],{{sfn|Reuters|2010}} and [[Canada–India relations|Canada]].{{sfn|Curry|2010}}

Indian cultural history spans more than 4,500 years.{{sfn|Kuiper|2010|p = 15}} During the [[Vedic period]] (c. 1700 – 500 BCE), the foundations of [[Hindu philosophy]], [[Hindu mythology|mythology]], [[Hindu theology|theology]] and [[Hindu texts|literature]] were laid, and many beliefs and practices which still exist today, such as ''[[Dharma|dhárma]]'', ''[[Karma|kárma]]'', ''[[yoga|yóga]]'', and ''[[moksha|mokṣa]]'', were established.{{sfn|Kuiper|2010|p = 86}} India is notable for its [[Indian religions|religious diversity]], with [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Islam]], [[Christianity]], and [[Jainism]] among the nation's major religions.{{sfn|Heehs|2002|pp = 2–5}} The predominant religion, Hinduism, has been shaped by various historical schools of thought, including those of the ''[[Upanishads]]'',{{sfn|Deutsch|1969|pp = 3, 78}} the ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yoga Sutras]]'', the [[Bhakti|''Bhakti'' movement]],{{sfn|Heehs|2002|pp = 2–5}} and by [[Buddhist philosophy]].{{sfn|Nakamura|1999}}

===Art and architecture===
Much of [[Architecture of India|Indian architecture]], including the [[Taj Mahal]], other works of [[Mughal architecture]], and [[Dravidian architecture|South Indian architecture]], blends ancient local traditions with imported styles.{{sfn|Kuiper|2010|pp = 296–329}} [[Indian vernacular architecture|Vernacular architecture]] is also highly regional in it flavours.

===Literature===
The earliest literary writings in India, composed between 1400 BCE and 1200 CE, were in the Sanskrit language.{{sfn|Hoiberg|Ramchandani|2000}}{{sfn|Sarma|2009}} Prominent works of this [[Sanskrit literature]] include [[Indian epic poetry|epics]] such as the ''[[Mahabharata|Mahābhārata]]'' and the ''[[Ramayana]]'', the dramas of [[Kālidāsa]] such as the ''Abhijñānaśākuntalam'' (''[[The Recognition of Śakuntalā]]''), and poetry such as the ''[[Sanskrit Classical poetry|Mahākāvya]]''.{{sfn|Johnson|2008}}{{sfn|MacDonell|2004|pp = 1–40}}{{sfn|Kālidāsa|Johnson|2001}} [[Kamasutra]], the famous book about [[sexual intercourse]] also originated in India.

This period was characterised by a varied and wide spectrum of thought and expression; as a consequence, medieval Indian literary works differed significantly from classical traditions.{{sfn|Das|2005}} In the 19th century, Indian writers took a new interest in social questions and psychological descriptions. In the 20th century, Indian literature was influenced by the [[Works of Rabindranath Tagore|works]] of Bengali poet and novelist [[Rabindranath Tagore]].{{sfn|Datta|2006}}

Traditional Indian society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy. The [[Caste system in India|Indian caste system]] embodies much of the social stratification and many of the social restrictions found in the Indian subcontinent. Social classes are defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as ''[[jāti]]s'', or "castes".{{sfn|Schwartzberg|2011}} India declared untouchability to be illegal<ref>"Spiritual Terrorism: Spiritual Abuse from the Womb to the Tomb", p. 391, by Boyd C.

===Clothing===
{{Main|Clothing in India}}
[[History of cotton|Cotton]] was domesticated in India by 4000 B.C.E. Traditional [[Clothing in India|Indian dress]] varies in colour and style across regions and depends on various factors, including climate and faith. Popular styles of dress include draped garments such as the ''[[sari]]'' for women and the ''[[dhoti]]'' or ''[[lungi]]'' for men. Stitched clothes, such as the ''[[shalwar kameez]]'' for women and ''[[kurta]]''–''[[Pajamas|pyjama]]'' combinations or European-style trousers and shirts for men, are also popular.{{sfn|Tarlo|1996|pp = xii, xii, 11, 15, 28, 46}} Use of delicate jewellery, modelled on real flowers worn in ancient India, is part of a tradition dating back some 5,000 years; gemstones are also worn in India as talismans.{{sfn|Eraly|2008|p = 160}}

In India, several traditional indigenous sports remain fairly popular, such as ''[[kabaddi]]'', ''[[kho kho]]'', ''[[pehlwani]]'' and ''[[gilli-danda]]''. Some of the earliest forms of Asian [[Indian martial arts|martial arts]], such as ''[[kalarippayattu]]'', ''[[musti yuddha]]'', ''[[silambam]]'', and ''[[marma adi]]'', originated in India. [[Chess]], commonly held to have [[History of chess#India|originated in India]] as ''[[chaturanga|chaturaṅga]]'', is regaining widespread popularity with the rise in the number of Indian [[Grandmaster (chess)|grandmasters]].{{sfn|Wolpert|2003|p = 2}}{{sfn|Rediff 2008 b}} ''[[Pachisi]]'', from which [[parcheesi]] derives, was played on a giant marble court by Akbar.{{sfn|Binmore|2007|p = 98}}

[[File:Viswanathan Anand 08 14 2005.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Indian chess grandmaster and former world champion [[Vishwanathan Anand]] competes at a chess tournament in 2005. Chess is commonly believed to have originated in India in the 5th century.]]
The improved results garnered by the [[India Davis Cup team|Indian Davis Cup team]] and other [[:Category:Indian tennis players|Indian tennis players]] in the early 2010s have made tennis increasingly popular in the country.{{sfn|The Wall Street Journal 2009}} India has a [[:Category:Indian sport shooters|comparatively strong presence]] in shooting sports, and has won several medals at the Olympics, the [[ISSF World Shooting Championships|World Shooting Championships]], and the Commonwealth Games.{{sfn|British Broadcasting Corporation 2010 b}}{{sfn|The Times of India 2010}} Other sports in which Indians have succeeded internationally include badminton,{{sfn|British Broadcasting Corporation 2010 a}} boxing,{{sfn|Mint 2010}} and wrestling.{{sfn|Xavier|2010}} [[Football in India|Football]] is popular in West Bengal, Goa, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and the north-eastern states.{{sfn|Majumdar|Bandyopadhyay|2006|pp = 1–5}}

[[Field hockey in India]] is administered by [[Hockey India]]. The [[India men's national field hockey team|Indian national hockey team]] won the 1975 [[Hockey World Cup]] and have, as of 2012, taken eight gold, one silver, and two bronze Olympic medals, making it the sport's most successful team in the Olympics.

[[File:Master Blaster at work.jpg|thumb|250px|right| In a career of twenty four-year span, [[Sachin Tendulkar]] has created almost all batting records, including most runs in both tests and ODIs and most number of centuries in both tests and ODIs, thus making him the most successful cricketer ever.]]
India has also played a major role in popularising [[cricket]]. Thus, cricket is, by far, the most popular sport of India. The [[India national cricket team|Indian national cricket team]] won the [[1983 Cricket World Cup|1983]] and [[2011 Cricket World Cup]] events, the [[2007 ICC World Twenty20]], shared the [[2002 ICC Champions Trophy]] with Sri Lanka, and won [[2013 ICC Champions Trophy]]. [[Cricket in India]] is administered by the [[Board of Control for Cricket in India]] (BCCI); the [[Ranji Trophy]], the [[Duleep Trophy]], the [[Deodhar Trophy]], the [[Irani Trophy]], and the [[NKP Salve Challenger Trophy]] are domestic competitions. The BCCI is also responsible for conducting an annual [[Twenty20]] competition known as the [[Indian Premier League]].

India has hosted or co-hosted several international sporting events: the [[1951 Asian Games|1951]] and [[1982 Asian Games]]; the [[1987 Cricket World Cup|1987]], [[1996 Cricket World Cup|1996]], and [[2011 Cricket World Cup]] tournaments; the [[2003 Afro-Asian Games]]; the [[2006 ICC Champions Trophy]]; the [[2010 Men's Hockey World Cup|2010 Hockey World Cup]]; and the [[2010 Commonwealth Games]]. Major international sporting events held annually in India include the [[Chennai Open]], the [[Mumbai Marathon]], the [[Delhi Half Marathon]], and the [[Indian Masters]]. The first [[Indian Grand Prix]] featured in late 2011.{{sfn|Dehejia|2011}}

India has traditionally been the dominant country at the [[South Asian Games]]. An example of this dominance is the [[Basketball at the South Asian Games|basketball competition]] where [[India national basketball team|Team India]] won three out of four tournaments to date.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/lahore/02-Jan-2010/Basketball-team-named-for-11th-South-Asian-Games |title=Basketball team named for 11th South Asian Games |publisher=Nation.com.pk |date=2 January 2010 |accessdate=8 March 2013}}</ref> The [[Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna]] and the [[Arjuna Award]] are the highest forms of government recognition for athletic achievement; the [[Dronacharya Award]] is awarded for excellence in coaching.
